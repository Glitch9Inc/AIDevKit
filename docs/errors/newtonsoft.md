> [!CAUTION]
>
> The automatic installation of the required packages has failed. This may happen in some Unity environments due to asset import issues, missing dependencies, or project-specific conflicts.
> In particular, you may encounter the following error:
> ❗ The type or namespace name 'Cysharp.UniTask' could not be found
> This means the UniTask library by Cysharp—which provides lightweight asynchronous operations in Unity—is missing or not properly installed.

> [!TIP]
>
> To resolve these issues, please install the missing libraries manually by following the official setup guides:
> Newtonsoft.Json Manual Installation Guide <https://glitch9.gitbook.io/docs/support/how-to-setup-newtonsoft.json>
> Cysharp.UniTask Manual Installation Guide <https://glitch9.gitbook.io/docs/support/how-to-setup-unitask>
> Each guide provides step-by-step instructions for adding the packages to your Unity project and verifying that everything is set up correctly. After completing the installations, restart Unity to ensure the changes take effect.
