If you’re encountering a timeout error, try the following steps:

Check OpenAI’s availability
Visit the OpenAI Playground and try submitting a prompt.
If that also times out or fails, the issue is likely with OpenAI's servers or your network connection.

Adjust the timeout setting
AIDevKit includes a configurable timeout option to prevent requests from hanging indefinitely.
You can increase this limit under:
Edit ▶ Preferences ▶ AIDevKit ▶ Timeout (seconds)
A longer timeout may allow slower responses to complete successfully.

Retry after a short delay
Sometimes, temporary server-side outages can cause requests to fail. If everything else looks fine, try again in a few minutes.

If you're in China
OpenAI’s services may be restricted in your region. As reported by Yahoo! Finance, some apps and platforms have been ordered to block ChatGPT access. If you're in mainland China, this could be the root cause.
