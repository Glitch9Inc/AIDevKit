This error usually indicates a temporary issue on the OpenAI server side.
Please wait a moment and try again — the issue often resolves itself shortly.

However, this can also happen if the prompt you submitted is too long or improperly formatted.
To check, try a simple prompt like:

Print Hello World

If that works, it’s likely your original input was too complex or invalid.
