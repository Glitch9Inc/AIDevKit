There are lots of other ways to continue using AI DevKit. For free, if you want.

Upgrade to a paid OpenAI API account – This is the most straightforward and affordable option. Most users spend less than $1 per month when actively using AI DevKit.

Try free alternatives like Google Gemini or OpenRouter – Both Google and OpenRouter offers access to several free models that work seamlessly with AI DevKit. It's a great option if you're looking to continue development without spending anything.

If you're looking for a local, cost-free option, AI DevKit also supports Ollama as an AI backend.
Ollama runs models directly on your device (or your own server), eliminating the need for API keys or internet access.

Create a new OpenAI account – If you have access to an additional phone number, you may create a new OpenAI account to receive a new free trial API key.
